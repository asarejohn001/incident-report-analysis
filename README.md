# Used the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident

# Overview
Created a plan to improve a companyâ€™s network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

## Using NIST CSF Framework core I
1. **Identified** security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security. 

2. **Protected** internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats. 

3. **Detected** potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections. 

4. **Responded** to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process. 

4. **Recovered** affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.

## Solution
Read the [incident report analysis]() I created.
